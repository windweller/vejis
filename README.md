#[AMD version of Vejis](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD)

This version tries to fit the standardized design of Asynchronous Module Definition, which is already adopted by RequireJS, curl.js, and Dojo. 

Language syntax might be different, reconsidered, while the main functionality stays the same.
